# DragonflightUI_Luna

DragonflightUI_Luna is an independently maintained compatibility fork of Dragonflight UI Classic for World of Warcraft Classic clients, with a dedicated WoW: Forever (Camelot) flavor in this package.

## What DragonflightUI_Luna changes

DragonflightUI_Luna keeps the established `DragonflightUI` addon folder, saved-variable name, and internal namespaces so existing profiles and texture references continue to work. The V1.1 package includes:

- compatibility work for current Classic Era clients;
- fixes for protected-frame and legacy API changes;
- restored HUD Edit Mode integration and saved layouts;
- action-bar, unit-frame, party-frame, raid-frame, cast-bar, buff, debuff, minimap, and utility fixes;
- client-specific TOC files for Classic variants; and
- publication, attribution, and third-party notice preparation.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release history.

## WoW Forever (Camelot)

The `DragonflightUI_Camelot.toc` flavor targets WoW: Forever interface 16001. It
adds compatibility adapters for modern spell, aura, quest, spellbook, and settings
APIs, treats Forever as a modern API client while keeping the Vanilla-era layout
branch, and leaves aura-duration handling to Blizzard's native UI.
Its Camelot-specific UI XML also avoids redeclaring Blizzard's currency border
template, which is already provided by Forever's modern interface.

## Usage

The addon can be configured through the in-game AddOns settings or with `/dragonflight` and `/df`. Edit Mode remains available through `/editmode`.

Do not rename the installed `DragonflightUI` directory. The directory name is retained for technical compatibility and does not represent the public project name.
